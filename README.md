# *hMod* heuristic framework

*hMod* is a Java-based library for modeling and implementing algorithms, including heuristic methods. hMod provides a detailed object-oriented representation of algorithms through a pattern-like implementation. Data, operation and structure of algorithms can be implemented as decoupled entities along with their combination in a flexible approach. 

The framework core has been built to seize this representation; thus, *hMod* is suited for implementing heuristics of diverse complexity levels, ranging from simpler heuristics to major hyper-heuristic architectures. 

Additionally, *hMod* provides several heuristic-implementation helper functionalities, such as:

- Support for managing and loading modules, i.e., bundles that include algorithmic components, their definitions and configurations.
- A console that make it possible to execute commands for experimental tasks related to algorithms.
- Scripting support (based on Javascript) for algorithm assembly and configuration.
- A bundled, lightweight, static method-based dependency injection system for algorithmic component integration.

*hMod* was designed and implemented in context of my doctoral thesis named *"Algorithm Assembling applied to Hyper-Heuristic Architectures"*. Until further documentation be avaiable, please check the following documentation for knowing its internal mechanisms and usage examples:

- An extract of my thesis, particularly the framework chapter, is available in the file [mod-docs.pdf](hmod-docs.pdf).
